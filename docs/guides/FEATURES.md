- Root squashing options
- Auto-generated StorageClass YAML
- PersistentVolume examples

**Generated Kubernetes YAML:**
```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: truenas-nfs-tank-k8s
provisioner: nfs.csi.k8s.io
parameters:
  server: 192.168.1.100
  share: /mnt/tank/k8s-volumes
```

#### iSCSI Targets for Block Storage
```
"Create a 100GB iSCSI target called postgres-data"
"Set up 50GB block storage for mongodb in tank/iscsi"
```

**Features:**
- Block-level storage for databases
- Automatic extent creation
- iSCSI qualified names (IQN)
- Multiple LUN support

### ü§ñ Automation

#### Snapshot Policies
```
"Create daily snapshots of tank/important keeping 30 days"
"Set up hourly snapshots for tank/databases with 24 hour retention"
"Schedule weekly snapshots of tank/homes keeping 4 weeks"
```

**Schedule options:**
- Hourly, daily, weekly, monthly
- Custom cron expressions
- Flexible retention periods
- Recursive snapshots

**Example schedule:**
```python
{
    "minute": "0",
    "hour": "2",      # 2 AM
    "dom": "*",       # Every day
    "month": "*",     # Every month
    "dow": "*"        # Every day of week
}
```

## Best Practices

### üèÜ Recommended Patterns

1. **Dataset Hierarchy**
   ```
   tank/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/          # Application data
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backups/       # Backup storage
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ media/         # Large media files
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ users/         # User home directories
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vms/           # Virtual machine storage
   ```

2. **Compression Strategy**
   - `lz4` - General purpose (default)
   - `zstd` - Better compression for archives
   - `off` - Media files, encrypted data

3. **Snapshot Retention**
   - Hourly: 24-48 snapshots
   - Daily: 7-30 snapshots
   - Weekly: 4-12 snapshots
   - Monthly: 6-12 snapshots

4. **Permission Models**
   - User homes: 700 or 750
   - Shared data: 770 or 775
   - Public read: 755
   - Sensitive: 700 with ACLs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

1. **Recursive Operations**
   - Always verify dataset contents before recursive changes
   - Recursive permission changes can't be easily undone
   - Consider creating a snapshot before major changes

2. **Storage Efficiency**
   - Don't enable deduplication without sufficient RAM
   - Compression has minimal performance impact with lz4
   - Monitor pool fragmentation

3. **Kubernetes Storage**
   - Use NFS for ReadWriteMany (RWX) access
   - Use iSCSI for ReadWriteOnce (RWO) with better performance
   - Always specify network restrictions for NFS
