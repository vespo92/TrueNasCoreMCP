# GitHub Actions CI/CD Fixes Summary

## Issue
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the error:
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mcp>=1.1.0 (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for mcp>=1.1.0
```

## Root Causes
1. **Python Version Incompatibility**: MCP requires Python >=3.10, but the workflow was testing with Python 3.9
2. **Configuration Inconsistencies**: Multiple configuration files had conflicting Python version requirements

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated GitHub Workflow (.github/workflows/tests.yml)
- Removed Python 3.9 from the test matrix (now tests only 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- Added pip upgrade for setuptools and wheel
- Added explicit PyPI index configuration
- Added verbose logging for debugging
- Modified installation to try both `mcp` and `mcp[cli]` variants

### 2. Updated Python Version Requirements
Updated the following files to require Python >=3.10:
- `setup.py`: Changed `python_requires` from ">=3.8" to ">=3.10"
- `pyproject.toml`: Changed `requires-python` from ">=3.8" to ">=3.10"

### 3. Updated Python Version Classifiers
Removed Python 3.8 and 3.9 from classifiers in:
- `setup.py`
- `pyproject.toml`

### 4. Updated Tool Configurations
- **Black**: Updated target versions from ['py38', 'py39', 'py310', 'py311', 'py312'] to ['py310', 'py311', 'py312']
- **MyPy**: Updated python_version from "3.8" to "3.10"

## Additional Notes
- The MCP package is published on PyPI and requires Python >=3.10
- The package includes the FastMCP framework used in your TrueNAS server
- All configuration files are now consistent with the Python version requirement

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Push to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
3. The workflow should now successfully install MCP and run tests

## Testing Locally
To test the installation locally:
```bash
# Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed
python --version

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install "mcp>=1.1.0"
pip install httpx>=0.27.0 python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# Run your server
python truenas_mcp_server.py
```
